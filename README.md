## Using the Template to create your own Dictionary search app

You can now generate your own Dictionaries Search App, using this one as a template. 

Just follow this link to begin: https://github.com/occidental-lang/dictionaries/generate

Things you'll want to do after generating from this template:

1. Add your own dictionary CSV files in the `data` folder

2. Delete the `unformatted` folder

3. Edit the README and index.html files for your own project info

- delete the google tag from the index.html file
- alter the html `button`s and `searchPlaceholder` variable to line up with how you named your dictionary files
